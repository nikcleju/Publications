  abstract  = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.This paper studies a relaxed version of the analysis sparsity model, in which the signal produces an output vector that is not rigorously sparse itself, instead it is within a l2 distance from a sparse vector. Conversely, this can also be viewed as a synthesis model with the additional requirement that the sparse decomposition has only a limited component in the dictionary's null space. We show that if this l2 constraint is sufficiently tight, a sparse signal can be recovered via l0 minimization if the Restricted Isometry constant of the system matrix satisfies $\delta$2k-1 {\textless} 1, which is an improvement over the $\delta$2k {\textless} 1 condition used in the usual synthesis sparse model. In practical simulations, the mixture of sparsity and l2 constraints leads to reduced recovery errors when sparsity alone is not enough.},
